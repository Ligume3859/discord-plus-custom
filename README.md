My custom edit of the discord-plus theme

## User customization
This theme is **very customizable**.
The variables in the theme file allow you to change many things, including but not limited to:
* Background image
* Accent color
* Up to three fonts
* Home icon
* Background cover colors
* UI corner roundness
* Overall spacing

If customizing the theme is difficult, [the original creator's Discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/2Jwh2nS) can help!
